I honestly don’t know how they have managed to keep repeating the sentence to the same customers over and over. Oh & Jonny Vegas shops there. A lot of the times we may have a moan about staff, but today some customers need to learn manners and remember the staff are trying to help in an extremely busy period."],

My other favourite accompaniment was Bombette, a hot scotch bonnet dip, but M&S stopped selling it. I am now afraid they will discontinue my Caponata.
